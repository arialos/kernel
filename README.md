# ðŸ’¾ arial - A x86 Hobby Operating System
arial is hobbyist operating system developed in my spare time in-between school and work. It's 32 bit and targets Intel's i686 platform, with a philosophy of creating a system that is simple to use and understand both from a user and developer perspective. The current project goal is to reach a userland and have a basic window manager.
## Milestone 1 Todo
Whilst Milestone 1 is far away this serves a nice goal post before i tackle more complex problems like paging and threading for milestone 2.
- [x] Refine toolchain for compatibility on Linux.
